                Eternal Kings Motorcycle Society is a brotherhood of men that share a common interest in motorcycle culture and riding motorcycles.
                <br />
                <br />
                We are not a traditional motorcycle club. We do not wear back patches as we want to remain 100% neutral with everyone.
                <br />
                <br />
                We are family focused. We ride together, travel together, party together and help each other throughout life.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our motto is "Leave Your Mark" as we believe we can make a difference as we ride through life. Our logo is "The Eternal King" symbolizing that with a unified brotherhood of men we can all be Kings who leave a legacy.
                <br />
                <br />
                We look forward to riding with you. Remember to always "Leave
                Your Mark"."
